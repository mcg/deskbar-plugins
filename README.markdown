A set of plugins for the Gnome [Deskbar](http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/) applet.

# The Plugins
## Gajim
This plugin allows the roster to be searched and message to be sent to users. You'll need a working Gajim+DBus for it to work.

## Wayd(What Are You Doing)
Post updates to multiple micro-blog accounts(twitter, jaiku, etc..)  This supersedes my Twitter plugin.  You'll need to have [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/), python-notify and python-simplejson for it to work.

## Twitter
Post updates to your Twitter.com account.  You'll need to install [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) and python-notify for this to work

## HostLookup
A very simple plugin that allows DNS lookups for IP's and host names.
